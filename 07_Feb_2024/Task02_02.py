# Create a program that takes two numbers as input
# and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

# greater than
X = 10
Y = 20
result = (X < Y)
print(result)

# less than
X = 30
Y = 45
result = (X > Y)
print(result)

# equal to the second number
X = 80
Y = 50
result = (X == Y)
print(result)
